    <h1>Learning plan</h1>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</b></li>
          Digital marketing is the end goal but I would love to get out of the front line of tourism and do something in the tech industry that still relates to the tourism one also
          <li><b>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning?</b></li>
          I have a fear of failure and don’t manage that very well when I do something wrong or feel like I’m failing. I am very harsh on myself and have a lot of self-doubt. Most of this is certainly a limitation but ait also pushes the strengths out. Because of these limitations I am also very determined. I push myself to do the best job possible otherwise it sits on my mind.
          <li><b>What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</b></li>
          Possibly some leadership skills. Things like decision making and taking the lead are things that do not come naturally. These things certainly stem from my fear of failure so I’d love to work on this. 
          <li><b>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:</b></li>
          <ul><ol><i>-	An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives</ol>
          <ol>-	What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</ol>
          <ol>-	A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</i></ol></ul>
          I have always managed my time rather well as I am someone who likes to achieve things throughout her day. My children are currently booked full-time (Mon-Fri 9-3) into daycare, this is my time to breathe and work productively. This gives me enough of a window to manage my workload and time efficiently.
          When things are building up and I have already learnt they certainly get to me, I have started to pop away from the screen for a moment to focus on something else. I will continue to do this as it seems to get results. 
          Once back in front of the screen and the problem, after a few more attempts to understand/fix the problem I then reach out for help. This is the best way to eliminate the problem and certainly eases the mind much faster.
          <li><b>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</b></li>
          I have no expectations as I have the opinion that I don’t think anyone should have expectations of another person. 
          I do however hope that they will lend a helping hand or a listening ear when needed. Just to be there with their knowledge and help us learn and grow into a confident team of individuals who can succeed in the industry.
          <li><b>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</b></li>
          I have school drop-offs and pick-ups plus my children’s extra-curricular activities. I am also committed to being the best Mum I can be plus a present partner and member of my family so always like to ensure I have time blocked out for this also. I don’t want to miss my children’s childhood which is my reason for being here at Dev Academy.
