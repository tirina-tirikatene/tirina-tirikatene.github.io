    <h1>Identity Values</h1>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.</b></li>
      
      <li><b>Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.</b></li>
      My whanau certainly helped influence my identity. I know who I am because of them. Growing up I was always secure in knowing that I had a village behind me supporting my every decision. I have always been very secure because of this. I’d say culture plays a part in them being who they are and raising me the way they did.
      <li><b>Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.</b></li>
      Determination and commitment would be my strongest strengths that will help my learning journey. I am very determined in things I want to do as my fear of failure plays a large part in this. I am also ridiculously committed to things I put my time into as they are taking me away from time with my children so these strengths are very important for me to have.
      <li><b>Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?</b></li>
      My limitations would be my whanau. I am committed to being a great mother to my children and a present partner which could certainly come with limitations. I personally don’t see these as limitations but more as a push to ensure I am spending my time away from them productively.
    <li><b>Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</b></li>
      During my time as Cabin Crew I had to work productively with different people every day. The aim was to work well with both passengers and crew. Most days were met with some form of resistance from either passengers or other crew members. It was always something to judge on the day what strategies to put in place as to what will work efficiently. If passengers were the problem then we as a crew/team worked together to find a solution. If it was crew that was the issue, we spoke to them and worked as a team to make it work. Communication was always key and more often than not, worked well. 
      </ul>
