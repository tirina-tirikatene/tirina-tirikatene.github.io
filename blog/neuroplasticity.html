    <h2>Research Neuroplasticity</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticty benefits
        people.
      </li>
      <p>
        - Knowing that your brain can change, adapt and grow can be very
        effective while trying to learn something new. It can increase
        confidence and maybe lessen the self-doubt knowing your brain will
        change. If you understand that your brain can adapt, it can help make
        you feel more secure to be flexible and open to trying new things. It
        helps you learn better and have a healthier way of thinking about
        yourself which contribute to improved mental health.
      </p>
      <li>
        Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for
        your benefit.
      </li>
      <p>
        - You might decide to learn a new language. Learning a new language is
        challenging and by challenging yourself you are stimulating your brain
        and creating new neural connections. To ensure the information sticks in
        your brain you new to practice, practice, practice! Practice these
        skills regularly to reinforce the learning. Use positive thinking,
        imagine yourself on holiday speaking your newly learnt language, imagine
        how good it feels to be confident speaking it. Always replace the
        negative thoughts with positive ones. Reinforce to yourself you can do
        this. This will enhance your learning.

      <p>

        Link to a resource that you found particularly useful or engaging.
      </li>
      <p>
        - I really enjoyed reading over this site, I found it very easy to read
        and loved that it had some fun different ideas than others. One example
        was taking a different route to work than the one you usually would or
        walking around your desk the opposite way.

    <h2>Research Growth Mindset</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant.</li>
      <p>
        - Growth mindset is a way of viewing the challenges and speedbumps that
        come up. If you have a growth mindset, you will still believe that with
        some practice the skills can improve over time. They know their
        abilities are not set in stone. It is relevant because we are all going
        to come across challenges in life and are always going to want to learn
        new things. Having a growth mindset can really benefit during these
        times. It helps stay motivated and focused on achieving their goals by
        using positive reinforcement and thinking/knowing “I can do this”
      </p>
      <li>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</li>
      <p>
        - I was surprised that growth mindset isn’t something everyone is born
        with. Knowing I may have to implement some of these reinforcements for
        my own children so they too can know their brains can grow and adapt the
        more they practice and challenge their brains. That the way their brain
        currently is, isn’t set in stone as long as they work on it.
      </p>
      <li>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</li>
      <p>
        - I am going to integrate a positive mindset into my learning journey.
        My self-doubt is not helpful therefore this is the first thing to work
        on. Second would be sleep. I am not great at ensuring I have a decent
        sleep so will be working on this throughout. Also ensuring I am getting
        outside for a walk in the fresh air to help with the physical activity
        part but also to refresh the mind and be outside for a moment can
        certainly improve my mood therefore my mindset.
      </p>
      <li>
        Link to a resource that you found particularly useful or engaging.
      </li>
      <p>
        - This website had a section on ‘Myths about growth mindset’ which I
        personally thought was an engaging difference from others as it caught
        my attention.

    <h2>Blend with your learning plan and strategies.</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your
        learning plan and strategy.
      </li>
      <p>
        - Personally, I think understanding the growth mindset will definitely
        influence this learning journey I am on. Sometimes it is very easy to
        think “am I doing the right thing” especially because I am going
        completely out of my comfort zone here and hoping to change my entire
        career path. A better way to now look at it is regardless of the future
        career path, I am growing and learning which is such a positive thing. I
        think by ensuring I am taking onboard a growth mindset it will only but
        help to have positive end result for my own personal health but also
        that of my family and the people around me.
