          <li><b>What is Emotional Intelligence?</b></li>
        Emotional intelligence is understanding and managing emotions within yourself (and maybe others) its recognising that certain emotions cause certain reactions, itâ€™s being able to regulate our emotions. It is a very valuable skill to have that can greatly improve both a personal and professional life.
          <li><b>How is EQ different to IQ?</b></li>
        EQ is managing ones emotions and is important for personal development and relationships with others.
        IQ I more focused on your intellectual ability and is helpful with academic and professional development
        They both serve completely different but helpful roles in a persons life.
        	<li><b>Why is EQ important?</b></li>
        Because it influences how we manage our behaviour and decisions. It helps to achieve positive life results by maintaining a healthy mental well-being. EQ is valuable to each persons professional and personal life. It helps to be able to form healthy relationships with effective communication. It helps to recognise emotions and feel empathy which I think is very important in building and maintaining any kind of relationship.
