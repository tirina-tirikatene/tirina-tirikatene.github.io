    <p>
      Utilising your journal findings and the high-level overview of the Human
      Skills learnings you have covered in Foundations - answer each of the
      following questions:
    </p>
    <h3>
      • What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego
      due to the Human Skills learning?
    </h3>
    <p>
      I have learnt a lot about the way I learn and cope with stress. I’ve
      learnt that I struggle with not needing to understand the ‘why’ I am very
      much always someone that asks why and find it helps sit in my head better
      when I know the reason ‘why’. I’ve learnt to laugh at myself when I’m
      trying something for the 5th time and its still not working. I have always
      been one to sit inside my comfort zone and not push myself out of it too
      far, this course has been the start of a large push very much outside the
      walls of my comfort zone so handling that hasn’t always been easy, it’s
      been great to test my determination and perseverance. I’ve learnt that I
      need to be kinder to myself and praise myself for the small wins that come
      along which really does give me a wee confidence boost by doing so.
    </p>
    <h3>
      • What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and
      programming?
    </h3>
    <p>
      I’d say empathy plays a big part as it can help connection. From my own
      learning journey I would say having empathy for someone else and yourself
      can help grow as a team. Understand everybody’s journey is different can
      help support learning and working in a team environment. Self awareness
      can impact your own mind and how you take things on board. I think it can
      be a positive thing in learning and programming as you understand your own
      boundaries, weaknesses and strengths. Being confident in taking on
      criticism knowing its to help your own growth.
    </p>
    <h3>• What has surprised you the most about the Human Skills learning?</h3>
    <p>
      I think the way it has resonated with me in my recent life events.
      Reading, learning and understanding how much being in the right frame of
      mind and how important a growth mindset is plus what it can do. I’m quite
      surprised by how much of it I can implement in my home life around my
      children also.
    </p>
    <h3>
      • What were the most challenging aspects of the Human Skills learning?
    </h3>
    <p>
      The hardest parts of it are actually putting it into practise. Taking it
      from the screen and popping that into the mind and implementing it in
      daily life. When things get tough or don’t go the way they should,
      remembering the things that were learnt.
    </p>
    <h3>
      • Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
      focusing on Human Skills learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
    </h3>
    <p>
      I think so much time is put into it because its important. It’s important
      as it isn’t very common to know/learn these things at any other point in
      life. I also think its important because during this course when things
      get hard, human skills will be important to know and utilize. It gives
      everyone a base for falling back onto when needed during this learning
      journey.
    </p>
    <h3>
      • Does the time you spent studying Human Skills learning here feel like a
      waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming
      instead? Justify your answer.
    </h3>
    <p>
      No, I don’t think it has been a waste of time at all. Over the years I
      have put a lot of time into my mental health and think this has been a
      great booster for that. It’s always good to acknowledge healthy habits and
      healthy ways to keep your mental and physical health on track. It becomes
      hard when doing something that isn’t the ‘norm’ and learning how to manage
      stress, emotions and your way of thinking has been great. I think the
      amount of time put into this has had a positive outcome for myself in the
      way of re-thinking when I am feeling less than positive about myself and
      the work I had been putting in. It was nice to automatically go into a
      frame of mind where I was thinking, ‘it’s okay, try again. Take a break,
      try again. Ask for help. Its okay to ask for help. You’ve got this.” That
      is literally my thought process each time I’ve had an issue so far.
