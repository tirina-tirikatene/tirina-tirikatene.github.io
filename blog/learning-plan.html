    <h1>Learning plan</h1>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</b></li>
        I am hoping to gain a career I love out of this, I would like to keep expanding after this and eventually look at
         digital marketing as my long term goal but have always wanted to gain tech skills and absolutely love to be creative so web design is the first goal to kick. 
        <li><b>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</b></li>
        I definitely still think my limitations are the same but again through my fear of failure it makes me very determined. I think there is always a silver lining to 
        every negative/limitation as long as you are looking for one. Foundations has set up a great ‘growth mindset’ so I think with that I can combat some of the self-doubt and fear of failure I have going on.
        <li><b>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</b></li>
        I think my biggest challenge will be ensuring I take time out to breathe also. I am not very good at knowing when to stop and take a break once I get into something unless it is 
        for my children. From what I understand of bootcamp I will need to ensure I give myself some breathing space also. I don’t like to let anybody down so if I am working as part of a team, I will commit myself and possibly over-do 
        it very fast especially with my home life requirements on top of that. 
        <li><b>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</b></li>
        Even as I type my answer it makes me nervous. I would love to work on my leadership skills. I get very nervous taking the lead which I put down to the fact I never feel like I am ‘good enough’ to be in a leadership role. My self-doubt always 
        creeps in and I am much better and confident being part of the team rather than the leader. This has always kept me from achieving more goals in life and has always been something to work on but I have never found the confidence to do so. 
        I am confident within my comfort zone and go into panic mode as soon as I branch out of that.
        <li><b>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</b></li>
        Support to me, or support that works for me is reassurance. Words of confidence and purely just mental support. I am aware my struggle is mainly a mental block so sometimes just need to be pulled out of my own head and assured that everything is okay. I love instruction and criticism as it helps me 
        focus on a certain task/step and eliminates the extra thoughts swirling around.
        <li><b>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</b></li>
        Based on my knowledge which is very minimal, I will reach out to my team (if working in one) I will reach out to the facilitators and of course always have a good google search. 
        <li><b>My commitment.</b></li>
        I am committed entirely to giving bootcamp everything I possibly can. I am determined to work and grow as an individual plus as a team. I am committed to growing my mind and being open to the stress and workload that gets thrown my way as I know there 
        is a bigger picture to look at and can not wait to celebrate myself getting out of my comfort zone and completing something I have always wanted to do. 
      </ul>


      <h1>Foundations learning plan</h1>
      <ul>
        <li><b>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</b></li>
          Digital marketing is the end goal but I would love to get out of the front line of tourism and do something in the tech industry that still relates to the tourism one also
          <li><b>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning?</b></li>
          I have a fear of failure and don’t manage that very well when I do something wrong or feel like I’m failing. I am very harsh on myself and have a lot of self-doubt. Most of this is certainly a limitation but it also pushes the strengths out. Because of these limitations I am also very determined. I push myself to do the best job possible otherwise it sits on my mind.
          <li><b>What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</b></li>
          Possibly some leadership skills. Things like decision making and taking the lead are things that do not come naturally. These things certainly stem from my fear of failure so I’d love to work on this. 
          <li><b>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:</b></li>
          <ul><ol><i>-	An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives</ol>
          <ol>-	What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</ol>
          <ol>-	A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</i></ol></ul>
          I have always managed my time rather well as I am someone who likes to achieve things throughout her day. My children are currently booked full-time (Mon-Fri 9-3) into daycare, this is my time to breathe and work productively. This gives me enough of a window to manage my workload and time efficiently.
          When things are building up and I have already learnt they certainly get to me, I have started to pop away from the screen for a moment to focus on something else. I will continue to do this as it seems to get results. 
          Once back in front of the screen and the problem, after a few more attempts to understand/fix the problem I then reach out for help. This is the best way to eliminate the problem and certainly eases the mind much faster.
          <li><b>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</b></li>
          I have no expectations as I have the opinion that I don’t think anyone should have expectations of another person. 
          I do however hope that they will lend a helping hand or a listening ear when needed. Just to be there with their knowledge and help us learn and grow into a confident team of individuals who can succeed in the industry.
          <li><b>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</b></li>
          I have school drop-offs and pick-ups plus my children’s extra-curricular activities. I am also committed to being the best Mum I can be plus a present partner and member of my family so always like to ensure I have time blocked out for this also. I don’t want to miss my children’s childhood which is my reason for being here at Dev Academy.
