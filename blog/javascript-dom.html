  <h1>An analogy that describes JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS.</h1>
    <p>We are rocking a house building analogy.</p>
      <p>So, let’s say we are building a house.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>HTML would be like the structural components. It is the foundation and walls of the house that hold it all together.</li>
      <li>CSS however is the superficial part. Its everything you might use to decorate the house, paint, carpet, maybe some wallpaper.</li>
      <li>JavaScript is then the part that gives the house functionality. Things like the TV, oven, dishwasher.</li>
    </ul>  
    <h2>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life.</h2>
    Today we are going to make some school lunches. 
    <p>Control flow (from what I understand) is following a sequence of steps which might look like this-</p>
    <ol>
    <li> Make the decision to make lunches </li>
    <li> Open lunchbox</li>
    <li> Collect items</li>
    <li> Add items to lunchbox</li>
    <li> Put items away</li>
    <li> Close lid</li>
    <li> Pack lunchbox into bag</li>
    </ol>
   <p> Whereas if I was making lunches in a loop: </p>
   <ol>
    <li> Start making lunches</li>
    <li> Check how many I have made, have I made enough?</li>
    </ol> <ul>
      <li>Yes, exit the loop </li>
    <li> No, continue filling next lunchbox </li>
    <li> Once I have made the required number, stop.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Control flow organises the steps needed and the loop makes sure the process is repeated a certain number of times. </p>
    <h3>Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.</h3>
    <p>DOM stands for Document Object Model.</p>
      <p> It lets programming tools like JavaScript play with the HTML and CSS of the webpage, it enables user interactions.
      We can access the DOM via web console. The DOM is then used to access the document and all its elements using JavaScript.</p>
      <p> If we were to go back to the building house analogy, the DOM is almost like the blueprint of a house. It tells you where each room is and what’s inside.
       We are able to access the blueprint which tells us where each piece of furniture is and then use JavaScript to change the colour of some of the furniture or even add new pieces of furniture.</p>
    <h3>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</h3>
    <p>	Arrays use positions/numbers to find items.</p>
    <p>For example, heres a list of colors.
      <ul>
        <pre><code>let colors = ["red", "green", "blue"];</code></pre>
      </ul>
        <p>To access each colour you would put:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>colors[0] gives you "red" (the first color).</li>
        <li>colors[1] gives you "green" (the second color).</li>
        <li>and so on</li>
      </ul>
      <p>	Objects use labels/names to find items.</p>
      <p>Now heres a profile of a person</p>
      <ul>
        <pre><code>let profile = {
        name: "John",
        age: 25,
        city: "Los Angeles"
      };</code></pre>
     </ul> 
        Now Here is how you would access each individual piece of information:
      <ul>
        <li>profile.name gives you "John" (the person's name)</li>
        <li>profile.age gives you 25 (the person's age)</li>
        <li>profile.city gives you "Los Angeles" (the city where the person lives)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Explain what functions are and why they are helpful.</h3>
<p>Functions are a reusable set of instructions that help perform a specific task each time without having to remember the steps.
You are able to use the same function anytime its needed without having to rewrite it.</p>
<p>Functions are very helpful as they save time and effort. They help simplify tasks and avoid the need to repeat code which also keeps everything much cleaner and less confusing.
