      <h1>Tech blog - problem solving</h1>
      <h2>Tell your non-tech friend a story about a time you:</h2>
      <h3>1. Were blocked on a simple problem:</h3>
       <p>At the moment I am blocked on a lot of things as I am still gaining understanding of everything.
        I do a lot of google searching, referring to the student handbook and if that still doesnt make sense to me I quite often jump on chatGPT to offer an explanation on
        what a certain webpage is trying to tell me.
        By breaking it all down into smaller parts and by writing it down in front of me usually helps me through.
        I have learnt through this process I am someone who needs things explained to me so that I understand, this makes everything 'click' 
        and also helps retain the information. I have descovered that I dont seem to retain informaton so well by just reading. I am hopeful 
        this will help in my learning journey as I now know what works better for me.</p>
      <h3>2. Elegantly solved a problem:</h3>  
        <p>I do not yet think I have elegantly solved a problem, my brain is totally jumbled. 
          However, I do look forward to updating this in the near future to come back and explain my very first elegantly solved problem.
          I have a feeling it will be just around the corner and that is very exciting to feel. 
          Stay tuned!
        </p>
      <h3>3. Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes:</h3>  
      <ul>
        <li><em>Pseudocode</em> - I am confident in knowing exactly what this is used for and how to use it but do still
        need to work on the logical flow of steps and the best way to put them into words to ensure it helps simplify the question/problem. </li>
        <li><em>Trying something</em> - I feel very confident trying things out. It is the only way I am managing to actually solve some of the tests by just trying it out.
        Knowing I can save and commit my work while something is workng makes me feel much more confident try things out as I can revert back to the last commit when everything worked.</li>
        <li><em>Rubber ducky method</em> - This method is the bees knees. I absolutely love this and feel very confident giving this a go.
        Each time it is tried and works, the confidence in this method grows. I genuinely love how something so simple is so effective. Saying something out loud or even typing the problem/code out and boom,
         you can usually see or hear straight away where the issue is and fix it.</li>
        <li><em>Reading error messages</em> - Reading these messages is slowly but surely becoming easier. Sometimes its a matter of reading it and knowing its not working but having no clue how to fix it so just trying something new out, 
          other times its an 'uh-huh' moment and feels very satisfying knowing exactly what its telling you and then ebing able to fix it from there.</li>
        <li><em>Console.logging</em> - This method I understand. I understand what it is used for and what it does but still have a bit of confusion around where
        and how exactly to use it. The correct use for it sometimes gets me but after having a wee play around, usually I get there.</li>  
        <li><em>Googling</em> -  I am absolutely happy in using google but sometimes it can throw me straight down a rabbit hole and unsure of where to stop. There are so many different pages and so many idfferent answer/solutions that it becomes very easy to 
        keep searching and trying to understand more and more. I need to work on knowing when to stop.</li>
        <li><em>Asking your peers for help</em> - This is sometimes easier than other times. I already have the feeling that I am in over my head so often feel a little silly asking for help when it's a situation I have put myself in.
        However I am getting better at it and have reached out for help to some peers outside of Dev Academy who are willing to help and explain things when needed. They have made me feel much more comfortable by being understanding with my struggles.</li>
        <li><em>Asking coaches for help</em> - This I still feel silly with at times but is something I have been doing and certainly eases the mind each time they reply. I know they are there for support and want us to succeed as much we ourselves do 
        it makes it easy to reach out to them. They are very helpful and understanding which always helps to feel confident reaching out more.</li>
        <li><em>Improving your process with reflection</em> - Reflection is something I have been working on even before entering Dev Academy. I personally think that reflection is very handy and elpful for the mind and helps to retain certain information by going
          over it in your brain. I often reflect with one or two closest friends also and it helps to hear other perspective also. </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>4. Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Consider what made you reluctant to do so. What might you try differently next time?</h3>
      <p>During the latest challenge - JS-Kata. This was the most stressful, time consuming, brain muddling part so far.
        I was reluctant to reach out a few tests in because I had already reached out during the earlier tests. It was definitely a hurdle to get past as I knew I was stuck and had tried many different things to figure it out but still didn't want to reach out as I was feeling a few things.
        I was feling very out of my depth, was feeling like I was being a touch annoying and was just feeling very overwhelmed by it all that reaching out for help made it seem like I was failing.
        Once I did get into the good mind space and reach out, it really helped as it was a fresh perspective and sometimes thats all that is needed.
        Next time I will definitely try being more mindful and proactive knowing its okay to not know everything and also knowing I can gain something from the questions I am asking.</p>
